vim-solargraph
===============

vim plugin (wrapper) for Solargraph - IDE tools for the Ruby language.


NOTES
-----

Please consider this as a first prototype ALPHA version, just to prove that it can be done.
I am not familiar with vimscript, so most of vimscript code is trial and error + a lot of googling.
This plugin was written in 10 hours after the initial idea.
